# Get Started

```
yarn install
yarn run start
```

It should automatically open the browser to the demo. If not, go here `http://localhost:8000`



# Wanna link it to a project to do integration?

Use symlink (this is what npm link does under the covers)

```
 ln -s /local-path-to/snackbar ./elm-stuff/gitdeps/gitlab.cbancnetwork.com/web/snackbar.git
 ```
